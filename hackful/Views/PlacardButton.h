// The "UIPlacardButton" class is a private class used in
// some of Apple's first-part App Store apps: notably the
// "Remote" app. It might also be in some private framework,
// not sure. Anyway, this class emulates that button using
// the .png files I stole from the Remote app. If you want
// to know what it actually, you know, looks like, I'd suggest
// looking at the "Connect" button in the Remote app or the
// "Get Started" button in the FaceTime app on the iPod touch.

@interface PlacardButton : UIButton {
